# CircuLaw

#### CircuLaw is a knowledge platform dedicated to enabling the transition to a circular economy by identifying opportunities in current law to support a circular future.

Amidst the escalating climate crisis, the global community is under significant pressure to transition towards a more sustainable and circular economy. With the European Unionâ€™s Circular Economy Action Plan and the Dutch government's commitment to a 50% reduction in the use of primary raw materials by 2030, formal commitment to this transition is taking shape. CircuLaw identifies opportunities in current law to support this circular future.

The City of Amsterdam, Dark Matter Labs and a growing coalition of knowledge and funding partners (https://circulaw-staging.vercel.app/about/Wie-maken-CircuLaw) have been working to accelerate the transition to a circular economy by identifying opportunities within existing laws and regulations.

This collaborative effort is aimed at making relevant and innovative legal information more accessible to policymakers so that they can adequately support the circular transition through policy intervention. This is done through research, exploration and creating of multiple services, culminating in the creation of this legal knowledge platform, circulaw.nl.

# Circulaw in the Dutch context
Circulaw is mentioned as an example of local and regional efforts towards acheiving circularity in the National Circular Economy Program 2023 - 2030 which is available in Dutch (https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/documenten/beleidsnotas/2023/02/03/nationaal-programma-circulaire-economie-2023-2030). CircuLaw is also mentioned in the The Integrated Circular Economy Report (ICER 2023) which outlines the progress of the transition to a circular economy in the Netherlands. The inclusion of CircuLaw in these reports by national government departments demonstrates that the use of current laws to stimulate the circular economy at a local and regional level is of national importance.
